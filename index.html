            Guinea Pigs, for the uninitiated are vegetable compactors which lack
            traditional hydraulic mechanisms as well as tails. Guinea pigs are
            not from papua new guinea and are from a cage in my livingroom. The
            optimal number of pigs is 2, ask anybody. Guinea Pigs also have
            talons not unlike birds of prey (which tend to also lack tails).
            Guinea Pigs make for better pets than most other animals with
            talons, and even have the ability to clean themselves. This allows
            for Guinea Pigs to go much longer than the average vehicle without a
            wash. Owners of geepee's should provide a healthy diet of
            consturctive criticism, positive reinforcment, and those treats that
            they like even though they are kind of expensive.

              Guinea Pigs need space, they're sensitive okay? They also need at
              least one friend so that the can perform ceremonial pig combat
              over resources. A pair of pigs should have somewhere between 9
              square feet and an aircraft carrier of space. If you do put guinea
              pigs on an aircraft carrier at least make them wear little sailor
              hats, like, please. I built my enclosure out of cube storage racks
              and choroplast, which you can buy at any home depot--and struggle
              to fit into your corolla at any home depot parking lot. All this
              space adds up to at least 30% of your house dedicated to guinea
              pigs, plus 75% of your refrigerator.

              Guinea pigs eat a LOT... like, a lot. I go to Vons like twice a
              week just so they can go hog wild on the daily. The pigs like
              romaine lettuce, roma tomatoes, cucumber, bell pepper, and carros.
              Cowpig in particular mows down that seeded white part at the
              middle of the bell pepper, she goes ham on that thing. Other than
              the veggies, pigs ought to be fed BALES OF HAY. Yea, like a horse
              would eat. Timothy hay in unholy quantities needs to be pumped
              into the pig cage daily. For an OPTIMAL PIG, something like 70% of
              its diet should be hay. There's also the pellets, they're kind of
              expensive but they give pigs vitamin C, which they dont make
              themselves for some reason, and the pigs like 'em, too. If those
              pigs been good, you can also give them treats if you like. Pig
              treats are usually compressed hay with stuff in it, but the pigs
              love the sound of rustling bags and they seem to like treats too.
              It also doesnt hurt that guinea pigs eat people food, so you can
              use food stamps to buy food for your pigs. Welfare pigs 💸.

              Guinea pigs are very exotic, like a fiat (the most exotic,
              guinea-pig shaped car). unlike a fiat, or a girlfriend, you should
              weigh your guinea pigs often, this can help you spot if there are
              any health issues under the hood. If you suspect an issue, you
              can't just take your pig to a normal vet, either. Guinea pigs are
              exotic animals and thus require exotics vets, which cost more. My
              Cowpig once poked herself in the eye while trying to Scrooge
              McDuck a pile of fresh timothy hay. My exotics vet recommended
              that "if it has anything to do with their eyes or their balls,
              don't wait." Now that's an exotic vet.
